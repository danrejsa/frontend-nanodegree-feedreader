# Feed Reader Testing

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". Using [JASMINE](https://jasmine.github.io), the Feed Reader project will illustrate browser based testing.


# How to run the project.

First, you open the index.html in your web browser. Note that this may take some time to completely load as additional network requests are made at that moment. When it is done loading, the test results will be displayed at the end of your page.
